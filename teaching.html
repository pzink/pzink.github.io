      <h1>Teaching & Advising</h1>
      <blockquote>What I cannot make, I do not understand.” - Richard Feynman</blockquote><br>
      <p>This resonates. I often make things using techniques, tools, principles and technologies that are the subject
        of my teaching. In my experience, no description of how something works is complete, and it is only through
        making or repairing a thing that a person can fully understand the detail. Where possible, I incorporate this
        practice into my teaching, and often encourage students to do the same.</p>

      <h2>Guest Lectures</h2>
      <p>In addition to the courses I taught as a lecturer at Boston University, I have been invited to speak in other courses at other schools, including Tufts and MIT, where I've discussed some of the projects I've listed here, held the train the trainer sessions for CAD instructors, and described how AR and IoT can be brought into the classroom, both as a subject and teaching tool.</p>
