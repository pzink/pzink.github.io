						<h1>Industry 4.0 / Smart Manufacturing</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Over six years co-directing the education programs at <a href="ptc.com/education"
							target="_blank">PTC</a>, I
						worked with industry, government and academic thought leaders creating industrial and
						educational systems
						leveraging smart and interconnected "Industry 4.0" technologies and platforms. <br><br>

						</span>
						Many of those projects involved using PTC's augmented reality platform, Vuforia, combined with
						their Industrial Internet of Things platform, Thingworx, to create real-time, bi-directional
						digital twins. We used a Universal Robotics UR3 and
						Allen-Bradley Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and created demonstrations to help thought
						leading faculty understand how they could incorporate these tools into their classes.
					</p>

					<p>I've collaborated with and advised dozens of engineering faculty globally, exploring the
						principles, concepts and technologies involved with smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. One of
						the larger
						projects I helped with is the Smart Factory at Purdue Polytechnic Institute.</p>


					<p>Beginning in 2019, I worked closely with the Purdue polytechnic faculty, technical staff and
						administration to help
						them conceptualize, design and realize a <a
							href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/experience-purdue-smart-manufacturing-labs">Smart
							Learning Factory</a> for
						their undergraduate students, introducing them to the concepts of digital engineering. I also
						provided a framework
						and outline for their <a
							href="https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/smart-manufacturing-industrial-informatics">Smart
							Manufacturing
							curriculum</a>.</p>

					<h2>PLC controlled Lego SPIKE Prime</h2>
					<div class="row gtr-200">
						
						<p>This short video shows how we were using a Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley PLC integrated
							into a small,
							portable demonstration platform. I wrote ladder logic in the PLC to control the attached,
							light array. Using a
							prototype spatial computing platform, <a href="https://spatialtoolbox.vuforia.com"
								target="_blank">Vuforia Spatial Toolbox</a>, I connected to the Lego spike prime over
							Bluetooth, and could control its motion using the parameters coming from the PLC. When the
							light was green the
							vehicle would go, for yellow it would go at half speed, and when red it would stop.</p>
						<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/PLC-AR-short.webp"></span>
							
							The camera pans out to show the view of an iPad, which was running an AR experience at the
							same time. In the
							augmented reality experience, there is a AR stop light on a lamp post, which is also
							connected to the data
							from the PLC through thing works and updates in real time. Note that the thing works
							instance used in this
							demonstration was hosted in the cloud, so the PLC is sending the state of the system to the
							cloud, which is
							then coming back to the iPad. When the light turns from yellow to red, you can see a small
							delay between the
							actual lights on the PLC demonstrator versus the AR traffic light due to that added
							complexity.
						</p>
						<p>On the left side of the screen of the IOT demonstrator shows Rockwell Automation's Emulate
							3D, where we also
							imported a 3-D model of the light post and we're able to animate it in real time as part of
							their automation
							software, and the right side of the screen shows a simple Thingworx 'mashup' or dashboard,
							with a 2D digital
							twin of the traffic light.</p>

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/PLC-CAD-dt.webp"></span>The video at right shows the same I4.0 demonstrator and program running, but in this case,
							the data is being
							sent to Onshape to animate a CAD model in near-real-time. The demonstration leverages REST
							API protocol, which
							isn't meant for real time processing, and generally includes approximately a one second
							delay.</p>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ur-ar.webp"></span>Both at BU and PTC, I bought and
							used Universal Robots. At PTC we used the UR-3 to create several
							demonstrations and examples of how to integrate with PTC technologies like augmented reality
							to help factory workers improve quality and productivity. <br></p>

					<h2>Universal Robot Mini-Digital Engineering Lab</h2>
					<div class="row gtr-200">
						
						<p><span class="image right"> <img src="images/robot-cart.webp"></span>One of the most useful
							examples I created was a re-creation of a demonstration I first built at Boston University,
							where
							the robot rolls a die, a vision system locates the die, picks it up, counts the number on
							the
							top face and stores that in a database, then rolls the die again and again. AT PTC I built a
							portable cart for the robot, which allowed us to move this demonstration to conference
							rooms.
							<br>
							This was a great way to generate a large data set, end
							of the results of the day could be used to trigger different events in a more complex
							demonstration system.</p>

					<h2>LEGO for Manufacturing</h2>
					<div class="row gtr-200">
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/plinko.webp"></span>Universal robots are easy to use, affordable and relatively safe. For even lower budget
							solutions, I like to use LEGO as a way to apply some of the same principles.<br> 
							<br>I also created a small
							version of the classic "Let's Make a Deal" Plinko game, as a way to try to generate a large
							data set with a repeatable
							process with some variation. The Lego elevator would drop the disc, which could fall into
							either the left or
							right channel, which was recorded and stored. An example of natural variation in a
							manufacturing system.
						</p>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mfg-loop-legobot-cr.gif"></span>This LEGO robot is another simple example of a closed-loop manufacturing system with state-based control and a vision system.
In creating any kind of manufacturing demonstration system, a challenge is to build it to be good enough to generate lots of data, and bad enough so that there is enough variation between operations to approxiomate reality. </p>
