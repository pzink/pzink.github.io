            <h1>Marine Electrical Propulsion</h1>
          </header>
          <p>Last winter the 50-year-old engine on my sailboat seized, and I replaced the propulsion system with a 10 kW
            electric motor. This page contains some of what I've learned from these experiences and others, and details
            of that conversion.
          </p>

          <h2>1974 Sabre 28, "Mandy"</h2>
          <p>
            In 2024, my 1974 Sabre 28 sailboat had an auxiliary engine&mdash;a 1975 vintage 30hp Atomic Four gasoline
            engine.</p>
          <p>The Atomic Four was raw water cooled, which meant that the inside had been exposed to a lot of salt. As a
            relatively new
            user of this engine, I didn't know that it wasn't meant to run in idle. When this engine idles (which I did
            sometimes for long periods while sailing and fishing) the raw, salt cooling water, which combines with the
            exhaust in the exhaust manifold, can accumulate in the exhaust pipe and then can flow back into the pistons
            and valves when the engine is shut off, especially if the water hadn't been blown out by revving it before
            shutdown.
          </p>

          </div>
          <div class="row gtr-200">

            <p>Unfortunately, I rarely revved it up before shutting it off to blow out the water, and it seized
              that summer. It was so rusted in the first two pistons and related valves and that one of the exhaust
              valve stems broke off when I was trying to free it; it was rusted about 60% of the way through, so I think
              this happened in the past as well. After looking at my options and their costs, I decided to replace it
              with
              an electric system using a kit from <a
                href="https://www.thunderstruck-ev.com/electric-sailboat-kits-and-accessories/"
                target="_blank">ThunderStruck Motors</a>.</p>

                <h4>ThunderStruck Motors 10kW Sailboat Kit&mdash;Key Notes:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>"...often used to replace 30hp combustion engines!"</li>
                  <li>Battery requirements: cell chemistry, amp hour rating, overall pack voltage, series cell count and
                    arrangement</li>
                  <li>"What batteries should you use? Most customers are happy with sealed, deep cycle lead acid...Use 4
                    in
                    series to get 48v, with a 100 Amp Hour capacity minimum. Larger capacity will give a longer run
                    time."
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I decided to use lithium iron polymer (LFP) batteries instead of lead acid, but otherwise followed
                  their
                  advice.</p>

              <h2>Design & Calculations</h2>
              <p>I used half speed calculations and an <a href="https://www.eboatcalculator.com" target="_blank">free
                  calculator/spreadsheet</a> to determine how long a 200 amp hour battery
                pack at nominal 48V would last, given the specs of the ThunderStruck motor and the size of my boat:</p>

              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.3.png" alt="System wiring diagram"
                class="project-image">

              <ul>
                <li>Calculator suggested ~4 hours at cruising speed of 4.5 knots (28ft boat hull speed is 6.4 kts)</li>
                <li>Charge time for 10 kilowatt hour system (200Ah * ~50V): With 640W and 8 hours of effective sunlight
                  per
                  day, full charge in less than three days</li>
                <li>Most usage: brief motor operation for mooring/slip operations</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>3D Modeling & Design</h3>
              <p>In the winter of 2024, I used the Onshape app with a device with LIDAR to scan the hull:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.4.png" alt="3D surface model of the hull"
                class="project-image">

              <p>I used the scan and original drawings from practicalsailor.com with help from a friend to create a
                simple,
                but accurate surface model of the hull:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.4a.png" alt="3D surface model of the hull"
                class="project-image">

              <p>I used that model and the drawings to model the bulkhead surfaces for supporting the propulsion system
                and
                electronics:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.4b.png" alt="Bulkhead surface models"
                class="project-image">

              <p>Components modeled in-context:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.5.png" alt="Components modeled in context"
                class="project-image">

              <p>Having estimates of required wire length from the bill of materials and planning wire routing
                beforehand
                saved significant time. Even with all that forethought, the 12V system, and networking wiring still
                needs
                work to clean up.</p>

              <h3>Solar Panel Installation</h3>
              <p>I designed a stainless steel structure to attach to the existing push pit railing and an 8020 frame to
                support the solar panels:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.6.png"
                alt="Solar panel support structure design" class="project-image">

              <p>and performed FEA with Onshape to explore different configurations and ensure structural integrity
                under
                vertical and shear loads.</p>

              <p>Using my boom as a crane, the panels went on easily:</p>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.7.png" alt="Solar panel installation"
                class="project-image">

              <h3>Electronics & Monitoring</h3>
              <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.8.png" alt="Electronics monitoring system"
                class="project-image">

              <p>The remote monitoring capability has made it enjoyable to track charging and battery state even when
                not
                sailing.</p>

              <img src="images/vrm-data.webp" alt="Electronics monitoring system" class="project-image">

              <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>One significant mistake was misreading the cruising RPM that the old gasoline engine produced at the
                propeller shaft. I designed the current system to have an RPM of about 1/2 of that (around 1350 rpm).
                Rather
                than removing the 2:1 reducer, I'm considering a larger propeller to avoid increased cavitation risk at
                higher RPMs.</p>
