      <h1>Electrical Propulsion</h1>
      <p>Last winter the 50-year-old engine on my sailboat seized, and I replaced the propulsion system with a 10 kW
        electric motor. This page contains some of what I've learned from these experiences and others, and details of
        that conversion.

        <h3>Electric Conversion of a 1974 Sabre 28 Sailboat</h3>

        <div class="project-section">
          <p>In 2024, my 1974 Sabre 28 sailboat had an auxiliary engine&mdash;a 1975 vintage 30hp Atomic 4 gasoline engine.

            <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.1.png" alt="atomic four engine"
              class="project-image">
            It was raw water cooled, which meant that the inside had been exposed to a lot of salt. Unbeknownst to me as a relatively new user of this engine, it wasn't meant to run in idle. When
            the engine was idleing (which I did sometimes while sailing and fishing) the cooling water could
            pool in the exhaust system and then could back up into the pistons and valves when the engine was shut off,
            if it hadn't been blown out by revving it before shutdown.
          </p>

            alt="atomic four engine with the head removed" class="project-image">

          <p>Unfortunately, at the time, I didn't know about that, never revved it before shutting if off, and it seized
            that summer. It was so frozen and rusted in first two pistons and related valves and that one of the exhaust
            valve stems broke off when I was trying to free it. I decided to replace it with an electric system using a
            kit from ThunderStruck Motors.</p>

            <h4>ThunderStruck Motors Key Notes:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>"...often used to replace 30hp combustion engines!"</li>
              <li>Battery requirements: cell chemistry, amp hour rating, overall pack voltage, series cell count and
                arrangement</li>
              <li>"What batteries should you use? Most customers are happy with sealed, deep cycle lead acid...Use 4 in
                series to get 48v, with a 100 Amp Hour capacity minimum. Larger capacity will give a longer run time."

            </div>
            <p>I decided to use lithium iron polymer batteries instead of lead acid, but otherwise followed their
              advice.</p>

          <h3>Design & Calculations</h3>
          <p>I used half speed calculations and an online free spreadsheet to determine how long a 200 amp hour battery
            pack at nominal 48V would last, given the specs of the ThunderStruck motor and the size of my boat:</p>

          <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.3.png" alt="System wiring diagram"
            class="project-image">

          <ul>
            <li>Calculator suggested ~4 hours at cruising speed of 4.5 knots (28ft boat hull speed is 6.4 kts)</li>
            <li>Charge time for 10 kilowatt hour system (200Ah * ~50V): With 640W and 8 hours of effective sunlight per
              day, full charge in less than three days</li>
            <li>Most usage: brief motor operation for mooring/slip operations</li>

          <h3>3D Modeling & Design</h3>
          <p>In the winter of 2024, I used the Onshape app with a device with LIDAR to scan the hull:</p>
          <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.4.png"
            alt="3D surface model of the hull" class="project-image">

          <p>I used the scan and original drawings from practicalsailor.com with help from a friend to create a simple,
            but accurate surface model of the hull:</p>
          <img src="images/mandy-electrification/mandy-electrification.4a.png"
            alt="3D surface model of the hull" class="project-image">

          <p>I used that model and the drawings to model the bulkhead surfaces for supporting the propulsion system and
            electronics:</p>

          <p>Components modeled in-context:</p>

            alt="Components modeled in context" class="project-image">

          <p>Having estimates of required wire length from the bill of materials and planning wire routing beforehand
            saved significant time. Even with all that forethought, the 12V system, and networking wiring still needs
            work to clean up.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h3>Solar Panel Installation</h3>
          <p>I designed a stainless steel structure to attach to the existing push pit railing and an 8020 frame to
            support the solar panels:</p>

            alt="Solar panel support structure design" class="project-image">

          <p>and performed FEA with Onshape to explore different configurations and ensure structural integrity under
            vertical and shear loads.</p>

          <p>Using my boom as a crane, the panels went on easily:</p>

          <p>The remote monitoring capability has made it enjoyable to track charging and battery state even when not

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>One significant mistake was misreading the cruising RPM that the old gasoline engine produced at the
            propeller shaft. I designed the current system to have an RPM of about 1/2 of that (around 1350 rpm). Rather
            than removing the 2:1 reducer, I'm considering a larger propeller to avoid increased cavitation risk at
            higher RPMs.</p>
